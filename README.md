Problem Statement:
This internship project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of YouTube songs data using Power BI. The dataset contains key attributes such as video ID, channel title, title, description, tags, published date, view count, like count, favourite count, comment count, video duration, video definition, and caption details. The goal is to utilize Power BI to create insightful visualizations and reports that provide a deeper understanding of YouTube songs' performance, popularity, and user engagement. The analysis aims to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns in the data to aid content creators and stakeholders in optimizing their YouTube song content.
